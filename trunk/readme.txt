This is a short OutRun-like demo written in 2001.
It is written in Java to run as a Web browser applet.

For a better view of things try the more recent C++ port, available from http://kazzuya.com/kazrace .

The code is rather old and not meant to be easy to follow. Some uglyness had to be done to optimize for performance.
There are no comments, things are all over the place.. this is NOT meant to be good code 8)

I'm not sure if and how it compiles anymore. It should run, but my current main PC's Java VM is broken.

C++ can be a pain, but Java is a fat bastard of a VM !!
